# XEVO Space Game Simulator

Welcome to the XEVO Project! This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the project on your local machine. You have the flexibility to use either Kubernetes or Docker-compose for local deployment. This project is entirely open-source, and I've utilized ChatGPT for refactoring and tweaking, as well as GitHub Copilot while building it. I built this project from scratch in just one weekend. I thought it would be really cool to have a TCP server (kind of what WoW uses) that also communicates with a HTTP socket server that can then communicate with a web page in real time. There will also soon be an Unreal Engine 5 demo connected to the TCP server, enabling synchronized movement: when you move in the browser, it's mirrored in the Unreal environment, and vice versa.

###Below is a browser demo, its running on Azure:
